# Experiment 2: Compton Scattering

There are three main components of this experiment:
- We measure the energy of Compton-scattered gamma rays, as a function of the scattering angle. We check the validity of the prediction of the Compton formula.
- We measure the scattering rate ($\propto$ differential cross-section) as a function of scattering angle. Since the energy of our gamma rays is on the order of the electron mass, we use this to verify the tree-level quantum electrodynamics prediction (Klein-Nishina formula) and reject the classical prediction (Thomson formula).
- We measure the attenuation of gamma rays as they path through layers of plastic (of adjustable width), due to Compton scattering. The attenuation is related to the total scattering cross-section; this is another opportunity to demonstrate the success of the Klein-Nishina formula over the Thomson formula.
