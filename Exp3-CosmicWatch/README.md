# Experiment 3: CosmicWatch muon detector

CosmicWatch detectors (http://www.cosmicwatch.lns.mit.edu/detector) we used to count muon detection events at ground level. Using the data, two questions were investigated:
- What is the relationship between the muon flux rate and atmospheric conditions such as pressure and temperature?
- What is the relationship between the muon flux rate and the position of the sun in the sky?
