# Experiment 1: Cosmic Ray Muons

This experiment consists of two measurements:
- We have two muon detectors separated by $\sim 1 - 2$ meters, and us precise timing electronics to measure the time it takes for muons to travel between them. Using this we can measure the speed of cosmic ray muons, and compare it to the known speed of light.
- We have another muon detector capable of capturing muons in scintillation material; after the capture, the detector will also detect the *decay* of the muon. Using this, we can generate a historgram of muon decay times, and measure the half-life from the exponential profile.
